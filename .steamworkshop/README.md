# .steamworkshop

Publishing metadata for the mod's Steam Workshop page. Nothing in this folder
ships with the mod (the StageMod manifest never matches it) or is loaded by
RimWorld. A `Media/` folder for Workshop images can live here later.

## Description/

One file per language, named after the RimWorld language folders in
`1.6/Languages/`. English is the source of truth; the others are
machine-assisted first passes pending native review. Format:

- Line 1: the Workshop title for that language
- Line 2: blank
- Rest: the BBCode description

Steam has no API for per-language Workshop text, so updated files are pasted
manually into the Workshop page's edit UI (note Steam's own language names
differ: schinese, koreana, brazilian, latam, ...). The `release` skill diffs
`English.txt` against the last release tag and refreshes the translations
whenever it changed.
