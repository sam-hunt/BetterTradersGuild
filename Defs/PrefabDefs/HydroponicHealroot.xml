    Better Traders Guild - Hydroponic Healroot Prefab (EdgeOnly)

    Self-contained hydroponics setup for medical bay healroot cultivation.

    Features:
    - SunLamp at front (z=0) providing light for growth
    - HydroponicsBasin (1x4) at back (z=2), rotated to span x=0-3 perpendicular to wall
    - LifeSupportUnit on back wall for power generation and oxygen backup
    - AncientEmergencyLight_Blue on back wall for illumination
    - HiddenConduit power network connecting all components

    EdgeOnly Configuration:
    - z=0: Front (sunlamp, opens to room interior)
    - z=1: Growing space (open for light radius)
    - z=2: Back (basin against room wall, life support mounted on wall)

    NOTE: Spawning the healroot plant INSIDE the basin requires a custom
    C# SymbolResolver (planned for Phase 3.3+). For now, this prefab places
    the empty basin with full infrastructure support.
