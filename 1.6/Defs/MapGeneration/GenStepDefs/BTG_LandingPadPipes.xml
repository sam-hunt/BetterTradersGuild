    Better Traders Guild - Landing Pad Pipes GenStep

    Extends VE pipe networks from the main settlement structure to external landing pads.
    This enables traders' guild refueling stations to connect fluid resource networks
    (chemfuel, nutrient paste, oxygen, astrofuel) to ship landing areas.

    No XML parameters - uses the layout structure sketch from the map to determine
    where pipes should be extended.

    GRACEFUL DEGRADATION: If no VE pipe network mods are installed, the helper
    returns early after checking for available pipe ThingDefs. No errors or warnings.

    TECHNICAL APPROACH:
    - Uses LandingPadDetector to find external landing pads via beacon markers
    - Traces BFS paths from pad edges back to main structure following terrain
    - Places visible VE pipes along the paths for thematic realism
