    Better Traders Guild - Spawn Entrance Defences GenStep

    Spawns 2x2 autocannon turrets flanking each perimeter entrance door
    of TradersGuild settlements. Provides defensive coverage for
    the settlement's external approaches.

    PLACEMENT LOGIC:
    - Finds AncientBlastDoors on the structure bounding box edge (perimeter)
    - Ignores internal room doors (not on perimeter)
    - Places two autocannons flanking each door, positioned outside structure
    - Turrets face inward to cover the door approach

    ORDER 210: Runs after Settlement Plaform (200), before paint terrain (255).
    At this point the complete structure is spawned with all doors in place.
    But before any metal tiles (this spawns prefabs containing some) are painted.
