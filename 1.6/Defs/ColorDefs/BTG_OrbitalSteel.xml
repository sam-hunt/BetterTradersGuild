    Custom ColorDef for Better Traders Guild orbital settlements.

    This color is applied to steel metal tiles in TradersGuild orbital settlements
    to give them a distinct "orbital steel" aesthetic with very slight blue-tinted
    metallic sheen.

    Using this coloring over the ancient tiles looks less decrepit, and the lighter
    shading is less ominous and depressing than the default unpainted metal tile
    color.

    TECHNICAL NOTES:
    - colorType="Structure" makes this color available for floors and buildings
    - displayOrder controls sort order in color picker UI
    - Color values: RGB in 0-1 range (not 0-255!)
