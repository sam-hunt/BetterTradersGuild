    Better Traders Guild - Comms Console Prefab
    Working communications console for contacting factions and orbital traders.

    Features:
    - 3x3 prefab size
    - Edge placement (against walls)

    Design (top view, North is up, wall above z=2):
        x: 0 1 2
    z=2:   C C C   (back of console, against wall)
    z=1:   C C C   (front of console)
    z=0:   . D .   (chair facing toward console)

    Legend:
    C = CommsConsole (3x2, bottom-left at x=0 z=1)
        relativeRotation=Opposite makes it face into the room
        (CommsConsole has defaultPlacingRot=South, so needs Opposite)
    D = DiningChair (operator seat, faces same direction as prefab)
    . = empty space
