  Better Traders Guild - LifeSupportUnit Power Balance

  Reduces LifeSupportUnit power output from 3200W to 800W.

  In vanilla orbital maps, LifeSupportUnits are isolated in small rooms with limited
  consumers, so their high power output doesn't matter. BTG's settlement generation
  connects buildings in a map-wide power grid, which would give players access to
  excessive free power if left unchanged.
